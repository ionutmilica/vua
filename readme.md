# Vua Web Framework

Vua is a web framework made for my computer science bachelor final project.
Currently its instable and I would not recommend using it for projects that are ment for production use.

Several features are available:

 * Trie based routing
 * Guice dependency injection
 * Filters
 * Modules
 * Pebble template engine
 * Validation
